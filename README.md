# CountlessBot
A Discord bot I developed for a friend. All the features are a request of his.

# How to get started
1. Get Visual Studio 2017 and make sure you have .NET Core 2.0 installed.
2. Download the project in some way. Either by forking it or download a zip of it.
3. If it doesn't download it by itself, download the required packages.
4. Start coding and do whatever.

# Required packages
All these packages should be downloaded from NuGet through Visual Studio.
- Discord.Net
- Discord.Net.Commands
- Discord.Net.Core
- Discord.Net.Rest
